This project was initiated using CLion IDE. An open-source IDE of [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/).

## Overview
**Project Title: Student Record System**.

A simple Student Record System in C that allows users to manage student information. The program seeks to implement the following functionalities:

**1.	Initial Setup:**
  -	Displays a welcome message and prompts the user to enter their name then greet the user by their name.

**2.	Data Storage:**
  -	Implement storage for student information, including name, roll number, and marks, using appropriate data types.

**3.	Input and Output:**
  -	Add a feature to input a student's marks and display whether the student has passed or failed based on a passing threshold (e.g., marks above 40 are considered passing).
    
**4.	Student Records Management:**
  -	Implement a loop that allows the user to input information for multiple students until the user decides to exit.
  -	Create an array to store information for multiple students, with the ability to add, remove, and modify student records.
  -	Implement functions for adding, modifying, and displaying student records. Ensure these functions take appropriate arguments and return relevant information.

**5.	Memory Management:**
  - Use dynamic memory allocation for student records and ensure memory is freed when no longer needed.

**6.	File Operations:**
  - Implement the ability to save student records to a text file and load student records from a text file, storing information such as name, roll number, and marks.

**7.	Search Functionality:**
  -	Allow users to search for a student by their roll number and display the relevant information.

**8.	Calculations and Sorting:**
  -	Calculate and display the average marks for all students.
  -	Provide an option to sort student records based on marks in ascending or descending order
