Project Title: Student Record System
Create a simple Student Record System in C that allows users to manage student information. The program should include the following functionality:

1.	Initial Setup:
	Create a new C project using JetBrains Clion (or your preferred development environment).
	Write a program that displays a welcome message and prompts the user to enter their name. The program should greet the user by their name.

2.	Data Storage:
	Implement storage for student information, including name, roll number, and marks, using appropriate data types.

3.	Input and Output:
	Add a feature to input a student's marks and display whether the student has passed or failed based on a passing threshold (e.g., marks above 40 are considered passing).

4.	Student Records Management:
	Implement a loop that allows the user to input information for multiple students until the user decides to exit.
	Create an array to store information for multiple students, with the ability to add, remove, and modify student records.
	Implement functions for adding, modifying, and displaying student records. Ensure these functions take appropriate arguments and return relevant information.

5.	Memory Management:
	Use dynamic memory allocation for student records and ensure memory is freed when no longer needed.

6.	File Operations:
	Implement the ability to save student records to a text file and load student records from a text file, storing information such as name, roll number, and marks.

7.	Search Functionality:
	Allow users to search for a student by their roll number and display the relevant information.

8.	Calculations and Sorting:
	Calculate and display the average marks for all students.
	Provide an option to sort student records based on marks in ascending or descending order.
